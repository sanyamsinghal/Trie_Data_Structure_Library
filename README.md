# Trie Data Structure Library
This is a library for Trie Data Structure, which can be easily used by anyone by just downloading the "SerializableDeserializableTrie.h" header file and including it in their own programs.

This Trie Library provides the following functionalities using Trie Data Structure:-
1. Create a trie.
2. Insert words in the trie.
2. Find out how many words in trie exists with any given prefix.
3. Check for a given word, if it is present in the trie or not.
4. Convert the Trie into a string i.e. **Serializing** the Trie.
5. Create a trie from a given string(serialized trie string) i.e. **Deserializing** the Trie.

Implemented in C++ Language.

Note :- For Serializing the trie to a string, i have used special characters like '>' , '\[\' and ']'. So don't use these characters in words while using this library.
